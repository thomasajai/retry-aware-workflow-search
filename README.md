# Cost-Efficient Search for Agentic Workflows with Retries

Course project for [COMS 6113: Topics in Agentic Systems, Fall 2026](https://daplab.cs.columbia.edu/agentic-systems/).

The [full project description](PROJECT.md) is the canonical statement of the topic, motivation, problem, proposed approach, and suggested reading. Check the [course schedule](https://daplab.cs.columbia.edu/agentic-systems/) for upcoming requirements. The five requested papers are stored in the [local paper collection](papers/README.md).

## Research question

How can we profile and search model assignments for multi-stage agent workflows with retries under a limited evaluation budget? The search should account for success, deployment cost, and latency, including failed attempts and execution paths that terminate early. It should also report the cost of *finding* a configuration, separate from the cost of *running* it.

AgentOpt and VineLM are starting points. Candidate ideas include reusing measurements for shared execution prefixes, allocating samples to uncertain or promising configurations, and eliminating candidates that cannot compete. Small search spaces can be evaluated exhaustively as a reference; other comparisons include random search and uniform sample allocation.

The three papers emphasized in the September 21 meeting were [AgentOpt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.06296), [VineLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.23914), and [SCOPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.00774). These links identify the papers; baseline selection is still an open project decision.

## September 25 checkpoint

The [course schedule](https://daplab.cs.columbia.edu/agentic-systems/) asks each team to:

- Identify 4–5 related papers and explain the strongest 1–2 baselines.
- Show one initial experiment: the question, comparison, first result, and what was learned.
- Duplicate and complete slides 4–9 of the course's linked deck, append the team slides before class, and rehearse a 10-minute presentation (5 minutes related work and baselines; 5 minutes first result).

The full experiment plot is due October 9. This is a tracking list from the course website, not a record of completed work.

The meeting notes summarize discussion and tentative ideas. They do not automatically turn every suggestion in the discussion or photos into an agreed team decision.
